                Land Trust-US and World Parks Endowment, is a US-based nonprofit environmental organization established December
                8, 1988 in New York. In 2006, then World Parks Endowment affiliated itself with World Land Trust, a UK-based
                nonprofit environmental organization, and became World Land Trust-US, as both organizations were dedicated
                to minimizing their costs in order to allow donated funds to flow to real habitat conservation projects on
                the ground. On September 16, 2013, as part of celebrating the organization's 25th anniversary, the World
                Land Trust-US changed its name to Rainforest Trust.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rainforest Trust focuses on the purchase and protection of tropical lands that conserve threatened species, working across
                tropical Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For this purpose, it privately funds the purchase of large tracts
                of land by local NGO's for the purposes of protecting it, in a fashion similar to the Nature Conservancy
                by making use of land trusts. The organization also seeks to help in-situ conservation measures by providing
                training, capital and equipment for environmental stewardship in economically impoverished areas. Most acres
                are permanently protected for an average of less than $100 per acre. Since its founding, Rainforest Trust
                has saved and protected nearly 11,500,000 acres (47,000 km2) of tropical rainforest lands.
            </p>
            <p>Current President Robert S. Ridgely is an expert on neotropical birds, on which he has published several books,
                is a longtime conservationist, and is the co-discoverer of the jocotoco antpitta. CEO Paul Salama is also
                a noted ornithologist and conservationist who has spent his life protecting the tropics. At 19 Paul discovered
                the choco vireo and sold the scientific naming rights for conservation purposes, raising $75,000. In 1998
                Paul was a co-founder of Fundación ProAves in Colombia, one of the most effective conservation organizations
                in South America.
